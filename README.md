# Creating-Surface-Slab-using-ASE
Python script that creates surface slab using ASE.
The output structure with the surface slab will be saved in two output files, CIF and POSCAR.

I have now created an online simple corresponding GUI for this script. Feel free to try it here: https://surface-slabs.streamlit.app/
